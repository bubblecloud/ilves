Ilves
=====

Ilves enables lean Java web development.

Ilves accomplishes this by removing separate web servers, slow code/build/deploy cycles and complicated development
frameworks from the equation.

Ilves provides out of box support for virtual hosting, privilege framework, TSL two way authentication, LDAP,
OpenID and traditional full featured password authentication. Administration user interfaces are provided.

All aspects of Ilves can be customized including navigation, HTML layouts, css, icons, database schema, localizations,
 user interfaces and configuration files. See tutorials:
